   git clone https://github.com/thaku7469/Flow.git
   cd flow
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   cd client
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

   ```env

   GITHUB_API_KEY=<Your GitHub api key>
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<Your GitHub OAuth client ID>
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<Your GitHub OAuth client secret>
   CLIENT_BASE_URL=<http://localhost:[port], during development mode>
   ```

4. Start the development servers:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.
